# [Working Women Advocates](http://working-women-advocates.herokuapp.com)

This app is for women who have experienced issues in the workplace, like sexism and/or sexual harassment, and need an advocate to help them navigate their situations.

It's not in use yet but I have high hopes that it will be!

Here's [a link to a YouTube video where I present the app to my cohort at Fullstack Academy.](https://youtu.be/gys6ofGkXDA)

## The Code
Built on Fullstack's Bones skeleton, WWA uses React, Redux, Sequelize, and Express, as well as Material Design.

## Instructions
1. Npm install.
2. Npm run seed (if you want to seed the database).
3. Npm run start.
4. Npm run build-watch.

And you'll have it running on localhost:1337.
