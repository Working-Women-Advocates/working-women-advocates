# [Working Women Advocates](http://working-women-advocates.herokuapp.com)

This app is for women who have experienced issues in the workplace, like sexism and/or sexual harassment, and need an advocate to help them navigate their situations.

It's not in use yet but I have high hopes that it will be!
